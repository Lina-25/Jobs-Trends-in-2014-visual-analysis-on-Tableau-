# 📊 Jobs Trends in 2014 visual analysis in 2014 Dashboard

In this project, I analyzed job trends in 2014, visualizing the distribution of jobs across different industries and cities. Using **Tableau**, I created various charts and maps to highlight the key job statistics for that year. The dashboard allows users to compare job numbers by industry and city, providing valuable insights into the job market landscape of 2014.
